A] If you did not do any course on AWS before...

It is perfectly fine to start with this course if you're new with AWS.

Most learners start with this course on AWS Solutions Architect Associate, with some doing the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner as a less technical warmup. If you feel overwhelmed by this course, try to watch the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course first.

After this course, most learners move on to AWS Certified Developer or AWS Certified SysOps Administrator.
