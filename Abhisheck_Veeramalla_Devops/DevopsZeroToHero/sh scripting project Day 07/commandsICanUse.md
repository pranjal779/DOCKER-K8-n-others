there are a few ways to download the `cornJobReport.json` file from your AWS instance (IP address: ip...........) to local. Here are three common methods you can use:

**1. Secure Copy (scp):**

scp is a secure way to transfer files between machines. You'll need an SSH client on your local machine (most Linux and macOS systems have one built-in). Here's how to use scp:

```bash
scp -i <your_pem_file> ec2-user@ip...:cornJobReport.json ~/Downloads/  # Replace ~/Downloads/ with your desired download location on your laptop
```

**Explanation:**

* `scp`: The command to initiate the secure copy.
* `-i <your_pem_file>`: Specifies the path to your private key file (PEM file) used for SSH authentication. You'll need to have this key pair set up for your AWS instance.
* `ec2-user@ip.........`: Username and IP address of the remote server (your AWS instance).
* `cornJobReport.json`: The file you want to download from the remote server.
* `~/Downloads/`: The location on your local machine where you want to save the downloaded file. You can replace this with any desired directory path.

**2. SFTP client:**

You can use an SFTP client with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience. Popular options include FileZilla (cross-platform), Cyberduck (macOS), and WinSCP (Windows). These tools allow you to browse the remote server's file system and transfer files visually.

**3. AWS CLI Transfer Manager (cp):**

If you already have the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) set up on your local machine, you can use the `aws s3 cp` command to transfer the file from the EC2 instance to an S3 bucket and then download it from there. Here's a general outline (be sure to adjust the bucket name and region):

**On your local machine:**

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/cornJobReport.json ~/Downloads/  # Replace 'my-bucket' with your actual S3 bucket name
```

**Then, download the file from the S3 bucket to your local machine using the AWS Console or another tool.**

**Important Notes:**

* Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the `cornJobReport.json` file on the remote server.
* Replace `<your_pem_file>` with the actual path to your private key file if using scp.
* Choose the method that best suits your comfort level and familiarity with the tools.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully download the `cornJobReport.json` file from your AWS instance to your local laptop.
